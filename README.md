# Python-dice-task
This is a little challenge that I set myself during learning data analyst with python ( this challenge provided by Hugo Bowne-Anderson). Challenge is a simple math problem: you're walking up the building to the top, and you're playing a game. You throw a die 1000 times. If it's 1 or 2, you'll go one step down. If it's 3, 4, or 5, you'll go one step up. If you throw a 6, you'll throw the die again and walk up the resulting number of steps. Of course, you can not go lower than step number 0. And also, you're a bit clumsy and have a chance of 0.1% falling down the stairs when you make a move. Falling means that you have to start again from step 0. I tried to find a distribution to calculate my chance to hit the top, also visualizing it.
